Perfect — this is a **great learning + career strategy**, and I’ll write it in a **very beginner-friendly way**, assuming the student has **never used GitHub before**.

Below is a **ready-to-use `README.md`** you can copy directly into your repository.

# 📘 Abbacus – Python & AI/ML Course Exercises Guide

Welcome to the **Abbacus Python & AI/ML Learning Program** 👋
This guide will walk you through **how to complete and submit exercises** for every lesson in this course.

Please read this carefully, especially if you are **new to programming or GitHub**.

---

## 📌 How the Exercises Work

👉 **Every video in this course has a corresponding exercise**
👉 The **exercise name matches the video title**
👉 Your goal is to **practice what you learned in each lesson**

For example:

* Video: *Python Installation Guide for Beginners*
  👉 Exercise folder: `python-installation-guide`
* Video: *Python Data Types & Operations*
  👉 Exercise folder: `data-types-and-operations`

---

## 📂 Step 1: Get the Exercise Code

You can get the exercise code in **two ways**:

👉 **Option 1: Download the repository**

* Click the **Code** button on GitHub
* Select **Download ZIP**
* Extract it on your computer

👉 **Option 2: Copy the code manually**

* Open the exercise file
* Copy the code
* Paste it into your code editor

---

## 📁 Step 2: Create a Project Folder

👉 Create a new folder on your computer
🎯 Name the folder after the video/exercise

Example:

```
python-data-types-and-operations
```

👉 Put the exercise files inside this folder
👉 Open the folder in your code editor (VS Code is recommended)

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Complete the Exercise

👉 Read the instructions inside the exercise file
👉 Write your own code
👉 Try to solve it **without copying answers**
👉 Test your code to make sure it works

⚠️ **Important:**
Making mistakes is part of learning — don’t be afraid of errors.

---

## 🌍 Step 4: Push Your Work to GitHub (Very Important)

Even if you are **new to GitHub**, this step is extremely important.

👉 Create a **GitHub account** (if you don’t have one)
👉 Create a **new repository**
👉 Upload your exercise folder to GitHub

🎯 This is important because:

* GitHub shows your learning progress
* Employers look at GitHub when hiring
* AI/ML jobs require strong GitHub portfolios
* You’re not just learning AI — you’re learning **how to get AI jobs**

We want you to **build habits early**, even as a beginner.

---

## 📣 Step 5: Share Your Completion on Social Media (Required)

After pushing your project to GitHub:

👉 Make a **LinkedIn post (IMPORTANT)**
👉 Mention that you completed the exercise
👉 Share what you learned
👉 Include your **GitHub repository link**

🎯 **Tag or mention Abbacus** in the post
This is how we:

* See your work
* Track your progress
* Review and support you

---

## 🌐 Optional (But Strongly Encouraged)

You can also post on:

👉 X (Twitter)
👉 Instagram
👉 TikTok

🎯 Share:

* What you’re learning
* A short video or screenshot
* Your GitHub link
* Tag or mention Abbacus

The goal is to **make your learning visible**.
Let people know what you are building and where you are going.
